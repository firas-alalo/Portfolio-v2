This website has been redeveloped as a standard React application, eliminating the reliance on external frameworks such as Next.js, which was utilized in version 1.

Consequently, commits are now characterized by clarity, simplicity, and directness, with minimal need for extensive edits observed in the previous repository. 

Further development is planned for the future.
